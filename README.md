# Driver Drowsiness Detection

- This system alerts the driver when driver found in drowsiness condition while driving.
- We have used Computer Vision to archive the task.
- Facial Landmarks dataset is used for detect different features of face.
- System plays alert sound when found the driver in drowsiness condition.
- System stores real time data in JSON format and show graphical visulization of data.
- This is just prototype.
- We have developed a hardware solution with the help of NVida Jatson Nano Board.
