# Driver Drowsiness Detection

- This system alerts the driver when the driver found in drowsiness condition while driving.
- We have used Computer Vision to archive the task.
- Facial Landmarks dataset is used to detect different features of the face.
- The system plays an alert sound when found the driver in drowsiness condition.
- The system stores real-time data in JSON file and show visulization of data to the driver.
- This is just a prototype.
- We have developed a hardware solution with the help of NVidia Jetson Nano Board.


### Prerequisites

- [DJango](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/) - The web framework
